Testo:  
baby I don’t want to lead you on  
feed you empty promises and never follow through  
there’s a lot of things that I do wrong  
if you’re looking for the perfect one this aint for you

‘cause what I’ve got is just an ordinary heart  
but I’ll give it more than anybody  
you can always trust this ordinary heart

maybe I don’t want to let you down  
tell you that I’ll always be around and miss my cue  
I can be a lover and a fool  
every now and then I lose my cool that’s what I do

‘cause what I’ve got is just an ordinary heart  
but I’ll give it more than anybody  
you can always trust this ordinary heart

I know you’re scared that I might change  
or even worse I’ll stay the same

‘cause what I’ve got is just an ordinary heart  
but I’ll give it more than anybody  
you can always trust this ordinary heart
